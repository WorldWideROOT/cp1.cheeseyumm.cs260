          <h1>History of This Country</h1>
        </div>
        <div class = "introduction">
          <p>  Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles (1781-1826). Raffles became a clerk for the British East India Company in 1795. 
          The British established a new trading post at Singapore and it grew very rapidly. As well as Europeans, Malays, Chinese, Indians and
          Arabs came to live and work there. By 1824 the population had risen to 10,000.In the early 20th century Singapore continued to prosper.
          Huge amounts of rubber and tin from the region were exported from Singapore. Meanwhile Chinese immigrants continued to arrive. </p> 
          <p> Then in January 1942 the Japanese conquered Malaysia. On 15 February 1942 Singapore was forced to surrender. The Japanese called Singapore Yonan,
            which means Light of the South but their rule was tyrannical. Thousands of Chinese Singaporeans were executed. However Japan surrendered in August 1945
            and on 5 September 1945 the British re-occupied Singapore.<br/>
          </p>
          <p> However after 1945 Singapore slowly moved towards independence. The People's Action Party was formed in 1954 and it proved to be a major
             force in Singaporean politics. In 1955 a new constitution was introduced. Under it 25 out of 32 members of the legislature were elected.
             In 1963 Singapore joined with Malaysia. However the union was short lived. Singapore left in 1965 and became completely independent.
          </p>
          <p> From 1965 to the 1990s Singapore enjoyed rapid economic growth. By the 1990s it was an NIC (newly industrialized country) and the people
              had a high standard of living. However the government was authoritarian and society was strictly controlled. In 1990 Lee Kuan Yew 
              resigned as prime minister.He was replaced by Goh Chok Tong. He introduced a more liberal regime.Today Singapore is a prosperous nation 
              and its economy is growing steadily. Singapore is also a very busy port. Today the population of Singapore is 5.6 million.
