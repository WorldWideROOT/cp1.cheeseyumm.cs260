          <p>Singapore is a republic and a parliamentary democracy, with an elective, non-executive presidency. The constitution came into 
            force on 2 June 1959. It provides for a head of state, a Prime Minister and a cabinet, and a unicameral Parliament. Elections, under
            universal adult suffrage and compulsory voting, must be held at least every five years. The Prime Minister is the   leader of the 
            majority party in Parliament, who chooses a cabinet from among the members of Parliament.The Parliament is made up of three types of
            members: 87 elected members (75 elected in teams of between three and six to represent 14 group representation constituencies and
            12 in single-member constituencies); up to nine nominated members (NMPs); and up to three non-constituency members (NCMPs)from the
            political parties. In early 2013 the 12th Parliament had 99 members, comprising 87 elected members, nine NMPs and three NCMPs.
